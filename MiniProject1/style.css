/* This style sheet works with Bootstrap

How It Works:

Bootstrap provides a set of predefined styles for various HTML elements 
and components this is done using a set of specific CSS classes 
that can be applied to HTML elements. 

These styles are applied globally unless overridden by more specific rules. Which
can be done using a custom stylesheet.

This is how you can override or extend Bootstrap's styles by:
1. Adding new styles for elements.
2. Overriding Bootstrap styles using more specific selectors
3. And/or by loading your stylesheet after the Bootstrap stylesheet.
(The order in which stylesheets are loaded matters. 
Styles defined later in the HTML file take precedence 
over earlier ones if they target the same elements 
with the same specificity.)
