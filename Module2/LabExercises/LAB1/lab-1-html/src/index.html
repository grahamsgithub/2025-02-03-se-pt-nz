    <!-- The difference between the h1 above and the h2 below is that the h1 is the 
    main heading of the page and the h2 is a subheading.
    This is shown not just by the size of the text but also by the fact that the
    h1 is the first heading on the page and the h2 is the second. which makes it a subheading.
    In terms of semantics this is important because it helps screen readers and search engines
    understand the structure of the page. -->
    <h2>Learning elements - div, span, p, pre, ul, li, ol, article</h2>
    <!-- Content added in previous points of M2LAB1 are inside this article tag-->

  because  div = block level element -->
    <span>HTML in a span</span> <span>CSS in a span</span> <span>Javascript in a span</span>
    <!-- The above will display spans all on 1 line because span = inline element -->
    <p>
      p represents paragraph without preserving spacing
    </p>
    <!-- The above means you can add spaces in the p tag but they wont
  be displayed in the browser. -->
    <pre>
    Text in         a pre element
    is displayed in a fixed-width
    font, and it preserves
